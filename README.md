# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is built using jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3.

## Game
- The game has a timer to indicate how much time has elapsed.
- There is a moves counter to show you how many moves you've made.
- The stars rating shows you how good you are.
   - 3 stars = 12 moves or less
   - 2 stars = 18 moves or less
   - 1 star = 24 moves or less


On completing the game, a popup lets you know that you've won.
